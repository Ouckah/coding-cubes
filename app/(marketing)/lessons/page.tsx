## Review
Great! So far weâ€™ve looked at:

- Print statements
- How to create, modify, and use variables
- Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication
- How to use comments to make your code easy to understand
- Different data types, including strings, ints, floats, and booleans
- Converting between data types

Here are a few more resources to add to your toolkit:

- Codecademy Docs: Python
- Codecademy Workspaces: Python

Make sure to bookmark these links so you have them at your disposal.

## Instructions

1. Let's apply all of the concepts you have learned one more time! Create a variable called 'skill_completed' and set it equal to the string "Python Syntax".

Checkpoint 2 Passed

2. Create a variable called 'exercises_completed' and set it equal to 13. Create another variable called 'points_per_exercise' and set it equal to 5.

Checkpoint 3 Passed

3. Create a variable called 'point_total' and set it equal to 100.

Checkpoint 4 Passed

4. Update 'point_total' to be the original value plus the result of multiplying 'exercises_completed' and 'points_per_exercise'.

Checkpoint 5 Passed

5. Add a comment above your declaration of ;points_per_exercise' that says: "The amount of points for each exercise may change, because points don't exist yet"

Checkpoint 6 Passed

6. Print a string to the console that says: "I got X points!" with the value of 'point_total where X is.

Checkpoint 7 Passed
